# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-SVM
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether credit card clients in Taiwan will default on their payments next month. The model is built on a dataset containing demographic details, credit limits, payment history, and bill statements, demonstrating practical application of SVM in real-world financial risk prediction.
